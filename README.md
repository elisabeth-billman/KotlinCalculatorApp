# Overview
This is a recreation of a calculator app. I wanted to use this opportunity to further my programming abilities and app development 
and found this to be a great experience to understand a little bit more about both back end and front-end development. This app is
programmed to receive input from the user to preform and display simple calculations. This was my first experience working with android studio
and the first time I've ever coded with the Kotlin language. I would say this project was a huge success and was able to help 
me in the language and get an introduction to app development.

# Development Environment
The environment I used was android studio and ran my code using an emulator.

The language I used was Kotlin and the libraries I imported are: androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
android.os.Bundle
android.view.View
android.widget.Button
kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.activity_main.

# Future Work
* In the future I would probably incorporate a better color theme
* Add more functions to be able to do more advanced operations
* add a feature so the user can display the calculator both vertically and horizontally
